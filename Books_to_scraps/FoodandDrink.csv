She isnât a chef or a restaurant ownerâsheâs never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsâand, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? Youâll get more than three million results. How do you choose? Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe thatâs downright bad?So Deb founded her award-winning blog, smittenkitchen.com, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor canâand should beâdelicious...every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to finding the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cookâthe ones with little time to spare, little money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients, and little help in the kitchen. And now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbookâmore than 100 new recipes, plus a few favorites from her site, all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of Debâs beautiful color photographs.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking: stepped-up comfort foods, stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons, an apple cake that will answer all questions: âWhat should my new signature dessert be?â âWhat is always welcome at a potluck?â âWhat did Deb consume almost single-handedly a week after having a baby?â These are the recipes you bookmark and use so often they become your own; recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws; and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time. Deb tells you how to host a brunch and still sleep inâplus what to make for it!âand the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and pizzas; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Pancetta, White Bean and Swiss Chard Pot Pies; from Buttered Popcorn Cookies to Chocolate Hazelnut Layer Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion. ...more",742702d662a71410,Â£23.59,Â£23.59,In stock (3 available),0

She isnât a chef or a restaurant ownerâsheâs never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsâand, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? Youâll get more than three million results. How do you choose? Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe thatâs downright bad?So Deb founded her award-winning blog, smittenkitchen.com, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor canâand should beâdelicious...every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to finding the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cookâthe ones with little time to spare, little money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients, and little help in the kitchen. And now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbookâmore than 100 new recipes, plus a few favorites from her site, all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of Debâs beautiful color photographs.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking: stepped-up comfort foods, stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons, an apple cake that will answer all questions: âWhat should my new signature dessert be?â âWhat is always welcome at a potluck?â âWhat did Deb consume almost single-handedly a week after having a baby?â These are the recipes you bookmark and use so often they become your own; recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws; and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time. Deb tells you how to host a brunch and still sleep inâplus what to make for it!âand the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and pizzas; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Pancetta, White Bean and Swiss Chard Pot Pies; from Buttered Popcorn Cookies to Chocolate Hazelnut Layer Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion. ...more",742702d662a71410,Â£23.59,Â£23.59,In stock (3 available),0

Annaâs crowd-pleasing Easy Fish Soup begins as a robust vegetable soup, with seafood added five minutes before servingâan ideal two-way dish. A vegetarian Lemon Risotto with SautÃ©ed Fresh Fava Beans is perfect on its own, and can easily take on tender shrimp. For dessert, have vegan Pumpkin Gingerbread and add vanilla ice cream, or serve a delectable Dark Chocolate Almond Bark studded with ginger and dried cherries.Annaâs festive âThanksgiving for Everyoneâ menu centers on a sumptuous Polenta Torta with Roasted Squash and onion marmalade, surrounded by an array of seasonal vegetablesâall pairing equally well with roast turkey for the traditionalists. âTaco Night at Homeâ allows everyone to design their perfect meal, mixing and matching from a spread of Spicy Black Beans, Poblano Peppers with Portobello Mushrooms, Carnitas, and Guajillo Chile Salsa. Annaâs exuberant Mediterranean mezze menu is a relaxed summer party, featuring vegan Roasted Eggplant and Poblano Chile Spread with flatbread, Tabbouleh with Chickpeas and Preserved Lemon, Charred Zucchini with Lemon and Mint, and Baked Lamb Kibbeh Wedges for the omnivores.With dishes inspired by the vibrant produce of farmersâ markets, Anna shares her love of cooking and of hospitality. Vegan Vegetarian Omnivore shows us how to navigate a world of change, and bring all our friends and family together at one big, generous table. ...more",4672d10b9b1e7a05,Â£13.66,Â£13.66,In stock (3 available),0

Itâs as simple as that. She isnât a chef or a restaurant ownerâsheâs never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsâand, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. D The long-awaited cookbook by Deb Perelman of Smitten Kitchenâhome cook, mom, photographer, and celebrated food blogger.Deb Perelman loves to cook. Itâs as simple as that. She isnât a chef or a restaurant ownerâsheâs never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsâand, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? Youâll get more than three million results. How do you choose? Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe thatâs downright bad?So Deb founded her award-winning blog, smittenkitchen.com, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor canâand should beâdelicious...every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to finding the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cookâthe ones with little time to spare, little money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients, and little help in the kitchen. And now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbookâmore than 100 new recipes, plus a few favorites from her site, all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of Debâs beautiful color photographs.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking: stepped-up comfort foods, stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons, an apple cake that will answer all questions: âWhat should my new signature dessert be?â âWhat is always welcome at a potluck?â âWhat did Deb consume almost single-handedly a week after having a baby?â These are the recipes you bookmark and use so often they become your own; recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws; and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time. Deb tells you how to host a brunch and still sleep inâplus what to make for it!âand the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and pizzas; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Pancetta, White Bean and Swiss Chard Pot Pies; from Buttered Popcorn Cookies to Chocolate Hazelnut Layer Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion. ...more",742702d662a71410,Â£23.59,Â£23.59,In stock (3 available),0
